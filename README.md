# AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial Application


## Overview

This application takes the developer through the process of building a web-application using
AngularJS. The application is loosely based on the **Google Phone Gallery**, which no longer exists.
Here is a historical reference: [Google Phone Gallery on WayBack][google-phone-gallery]

Each tagged commit is a separate lesson teaching a single aspect of the framework.

The full tutorial can be found at https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial.


## Prerequisites

### Git

- A good place to learn about setting up git is [here][git-setup].
- You can find documentation and download git [here][git-home].

### Node.js and Tools

- Get [Node.js][node-download].
- Install the tool dependencies: `npm install`


## Workings of the Application

- The application filesystem layout structure is based on the [angular-seed][angular-seed] project.
- There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application.
- Read the _Development_ section at the end to familiarize yourself with running and developing
  an Angular application.


### Installing Dependencies

The application relies upon various Node.js tools, such as [Bower][bower], [Karma][karma] and
[Protractor][protractor]. You can install these by running:

```
npm install
```

This will also run Bower, which will download the Angular files needed for the current step of the
tutorial.

Most of the scripts described below will run this automatically but it doesn't do any harm to run
it whenever you like.

### Running the Application during Development

- Run `npm start`.
- Navigate your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the application 
running.

### Unit Testing

We recommend using [Jasmine][jasmine] and [Karma][karma] for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

- Start Karma with `npm test`.
- A browser will start and connect to the Karma server. Chrome and Firefox are the default browsers,
  others can be captured by loading the same URL or by changing the `karma.conf.js` file.
- Karma will sit and watch your application and test JavaScript files. To run or re-run tests just
  change any of your these files.

### End-to-End Testing

We recommend using [Protractor][protractor] for end-to-end (e2e) testing.

It requires a webserver that serves the application. See the
_Running the Application during Development_ section, above.

- Serve the application with: `npm start`
- In a separate terminal/command line window run the e2e tests: `npm run protractor`.
- Protractor will execute the e2e test scripts against the web application itself. The project is
  set up to run the tests on Chrome directly. If you want to run against other browsers, you must 
  modify the configuration at `e2e-tests/protractor-conf.js`.
